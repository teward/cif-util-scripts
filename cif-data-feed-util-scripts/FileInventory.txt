The cif-data-feed-util-scripts folder contains utility scripts written to
assist with getting information from CIF feeds such as infrastructure/botnet
and other such feeds that can be generated, and to do something with that data

This FileInventory.txt file contains a breakdown of what scripts are provided,
what language each script is written in, what the prerequisites for each script
are, which version(s) of CIF this has been tested on and confirmed to work, a
brief description of what the script does, and the 'complexity'* of the use of
the script or modification of the script.

create-csv-for-all-feeds.sh
===========================

Language: Bash
Prerequisites: Configured libcif and cif executable to query a CIF server.
Designed for: CIF v1

Output: Multiple CSV files with this script as-is

Description:
This script is designed to create a CSV file for each feed that can be created
and generated and returned by a CIF server.  These include all the feeds that
have been detailed on the wiki (such as infrastructure/suspicious, for example)

Use:
Running the script will query CIF and output all the data to the current
working directory that you are in on the system.  Therefore, if the script is
in `/home/user/cif-feed-csvs/` and you execute it from that directory after doing
a `cd` into that directory, you will have the data output to files located
inside of the /home/user/cif-feed-csvs folder.

Warnings:
Very simple, very hackish, and probably could be written better.  It works
but it's a very simplistic script that could probably be better written.

Script Complexities:
Use: Very easy.
Specifying output locations: Impossible without changing the script itself.

The feed-gathering-util-scripts folder contains utility scripts written to
assist with downloading and storing feed data from a remote feed, to later be
ingested into CIF.

This FileInventory.txt file contains a breakdown of what scripts are provided,
what language each script is written in, what the prerequisites for each script
are, a brief description of what the script does, and the 'complexity' of the
use of the script and/or modification of the script.

update-cleanmx-data.sh
======================

Language: Bash
Prerequisites: wget, and a location on disk to store the data.
Designed for: CIF v1

Output: Two PHP files obtained from Clean-MX's data.

Description:
This script is designed to reach out to Clean-MX and obtain the feed data which
is referenced in the default (but disabled) CleanMX configuration file.  This
script is designed to be run to download the data locally to the server, and 
then later have CIF refer to the file paths on the local system to index the
data.

Use:
Running the script will reach out to CleanMX and download the data to a path
on the server.  That 'path' is partly configuratble, by changing the "FEEDDIR="
line in the script to the base directory.  From that directory, the script will
then check to see if the base FEEDDIR exists, and if not, will create it.  It
will then check to see if a 'cleanmx' directory exists in FEEDDIR, and will
create the directory if it doesn't exist.  It then checks to see if the two
PHP files (containing XML data from CleanMX) exist, and if they do exist it
will remove the files (because the same data exists plus newer data in the 
download that will be done next).  The script then uses 'wget' to reach out and
download the files and store them locally in the FEEDDIR/cleanmx/ folder.

Warnings:
A not-too-complicated Bash script which uses Bash functions as definitions of
actions, rather than a straight linear code execution.  I've put comments in
where relevant and important.

Script Complexities:
Use: Very easy.
Specifying output location: Changing the base directory in which to store the
feed data is easy, you have to change one line.  Changing the folder paths is
more difficult and requires additional changes to the code.
